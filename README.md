Open AI games

This is a place for me to play around with different reinforcement learning algorithms and explore their capability to solve various scenarios as provided from the OpenAI gym environment.

### Setup
In addition to SciPy, Numpy, the tensorflow python library, openCV and matplotlib there are several other
requirements that cannot be installed through Pip or Conda.

Installing tensorflow:

Getting CUDA v9 (required for tensorflow gpu use):

Getting cuDNN:

### Data Sets
Download and store in datasets/housenumbers. There are 3 files, grab each of them. They are MATLAB style .mat files.
